# CT414-Java-RMI
This assignment is an implementation of a basic share trading system using Java RMI. Using Remote Method Invocation, it runs both a server and client from the command terminal to buy/sell shares and deposit/withdraw funds. The available shares are read in from a .csv file.

### What is Java RMI??
Java RMI (Remote Method Invocation) is a Java API that allows a Java program to invoke methods on objects running in other JVMs (Java Virtual Machines).
It enables distributed computing, i.e. a programme can execute code on remote machines as though it were locally done.

Java RMI is still used today but mainly for internal uses. Its successor can be seen as RESTful archictecture using HTTP requests (as seen in my FYP project). RESTful
API archicture is more lightweight and ubiquitous in developer docs/ web services.
